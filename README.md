# ReefLifeTV

The ReefLifeTV Project is an Apple TV application. It uses the database and model from the iOS ReefLife apps but 
presents the data and information specifically for AppleTV.

Since the never version of ReefLife have deviated from the original version, a new project has been created. In order
to keep the projects in sync, all that really needs to be shared between the two project is the SQLite database and
the images.
